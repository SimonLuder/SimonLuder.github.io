# **About Me**

Hello, my name is Simon Luder. I am happy to welcome you here.

I am currently enrolled as part-time Data Science student at the University of Applied Sciences and Arts Northwestern Switzerland (FHNW) and work the other half as a Research Assistant in Data Science with a focus on applied research.

Throughout my studies, I’ve had the opportunity to gain hands-on experience through a variety of projects. Here is a selection of projects I’ve contributed to:

- Development of a latent diffusion model for the controlled generation of holographic pollen images. 

- Implementation of a deep learning-based recommender system to assess visual similarities of product images.

- Medical assessment of patients suspected of having uveitis

- Machine learning based classification of activities using smartphone senor data.
