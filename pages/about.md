# **About Me**

Hello, my name is Simon Luder. I am happy to welcome you here.

At the moment I am enrolled as a full-time Data Science student at the FHNW. 
In my studies I could so far gain various experiences in the areas of programming, data analysis and visualization, statistics and machine learning. 
Besides the theoretical education I had the opportunity to gain practical experience in various projects. Below is a small collection of projects in which I have been working on:

- Medical evaluation of patients with suspicion of uveitis.
- Analysis of sensor data for a test apartment setup at ETH Zurich. 
- Implementation of a recommender system for shopping cart data.
