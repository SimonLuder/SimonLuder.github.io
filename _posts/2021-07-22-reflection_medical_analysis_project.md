description: A reflection of the project Medical Analysis from FS21.

During the spring semester of 2021, I was part of a group semester project analyzing medical patient data. The goal of the analysis was to explore whether ocular disease, specifically uveitis, can be predicted by a variety of attributes such as blood and inflammation values. The causes of this disease are wide ranging and have not yet been fully explored. The results of our analysis should therefore help to identify potential patterns in the existing data and thereby contribute to a better understanding of the disease.

A total of four students had signed up for this project. However, we decided to form two teams of two, since we considered the overall control and the individual learning impact to be higher with this group size. I was very excited about the challenge because it was the first larger opportunity for me to implement machine learning algorithms at a real-world setting. 

Overall, the cooperation in the group went very well. At the beginning, we had to clean the data and bring it into a suitable format. Since we ourselves do not have any medical know-how, a close exchange with the experts was necessary for this step. Because we only had measurements from nearly 1100 patients, it was also a challenge to make significant predictions, especially for classifications with many different labels. The workload was well distributed. In the beginning, we worked more closely together, forming a common understanding of the data. Later, we divided the algorithms to be applied equally among each other and focused on different parts of the project, allowing for a more independent way of working.

I think one reason for the successful cooperation is that all team members already knew each other and had worked together before. As a result, there was a good collaboration in the team right from the start. We also had a lot of support from our medical expertsâ€™ team. Without the appropriate medical know-how, it would have been much more difficult for us to interpret our results and extract the full information value.

In conclusion, I can say that the project was very helpful for my learning progress and that I was able to gain a lot of new knowledge. It was very interesting to see how each machine learning algorithm performed on our dataset compared to each other.
